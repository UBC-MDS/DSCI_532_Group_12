## Motivation and purpose

Our role: Data scientists in non-profit organization for health care

Target audience: Unspecified individuals who are interested in COVID-19 

From February 2020, COVID-19 has been spread all around world. COVID-19 affects not only industry but our daily life. During this pandemic, knowing the COVID-19 statistics such as number of confirmed, deaths, and recovered in certain region has become key thing for our daily life and planning our future. For these reasons, we propose building a COVID-19 visualization app that allows unspecified individuals to check the current COVID-19 statistics and visually explore it. This Covid-19 visualization app will show the number of confirmed, deaths, and recovered for each country. Furthermore, the user could check the historical trend of those numbers.

## Description of the data

## Research questions and usage scenarios

The dashboard lets its users explore the trends of Covid-19's cases around the world, it helps to answer some descriptive questions related to this pandemic:

-   How many cases confirmed globally since the beginning of the pandemic?

-   Which countries have the highest cumulative confirmed cases?

-   Which countries have the highest death rate?

-   What does the trend of globally confirmed cases look like?

-   What does the trend of confirmed cases look like for a certain country?

-   How is the trend of Covid-19 related deaths at globaly scale and local scale?

Some typical usage scenarios can be described as below.

Alex is a pilot in the Philippine who lost his job in early 2020 due to all the travel bans, he has been doing surviving jobs since but his heart always longs for the sky. Alex wants to be able to keep track of the pandemic's statistics not only in his home country but also around the world, so that he will be able to plan for his career better once things get better or worse.

When Alex logs onto the Covid-19 Data Portal, he will see the overall number of confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases globally, there is also a world map illustrating where the pandemic hits the most (high number of confirmed case). Alex will be able to see the recovery rate, death in a million for different countries in order to know if some countries are doing better than others related to treatment. Alex can filter new confirmed cases, new deaths and new recovered cases by his country as well as other neighbor countries to see if there is a new trend or if they are hitting a new wave of infection. Given countries apply different prevention strategies at different times, some already started their vaccination program, Alex will be able to compare the trend before and after a certain date for a certain country.
