## Research questions and usage scenarios

Covid pandemic has changed the world dramatically in many ways since the first cases were reported byt the end of 2019. Alex is a pilot in Phillipine who lost his job in early 2020 due to all the travel bans, he has been doing surviving jobs since but his heart always longs for the sky. Alex wants to be able to keep track of the pandemic's statistics not only in his home country but also around the world, so that he will be aware once things get better or worse. 

When Alex logs onto the Covid Data Portal, he will see the overall number of confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases globally, there is also a world map illustrating where the pandemic hits the most (high number of confirmed case). Alex also wants to know the recovery rate, death in a million for different countries in order to know if some countries are doing better than others. Alex wants to filter new confirmed cases, new deaths and new recovered cases by his country as well as other neighbor countries to see if there is a new trend or if they are hitting a new wave of infection.
Given countries apply different prevention policies at different times, some already started their vaccination program, Alex wants to be able to compare the trend before and after a certain date for a certain country.
