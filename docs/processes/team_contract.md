## Review and merge task
Each member will be paired with a teammate as their reviewer with the responsibilities as below:
* Review and merge all pull requests (PR) from the member in a timely manner (pay attention to timezone difference)
  * Review all commits related in the PR following Definition of Done (DoD)
  * Make proper comments and constructive feedback

We will be change reviewer assignment everyweek so that every member can learn from the whole team.
