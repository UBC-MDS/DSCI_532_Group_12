### Submit chnages
If you'd like to contribute a feature or bug fix, follow steps below.
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository. 
-- you can fork our repo. It allows that you could edit any change in your own version of this project. 
2. Make change for bugs or improvement.
3. Submit a pull request.
-- After make any changes, you could submit a pull request. We will review pull requests within 7 days.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to
apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with 
your PR.  
*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), 
for documentation.  
*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions
with test cases included are easier to accept.
